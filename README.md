# Project - An Intelligent Customer Support and Feedback System with Sentimental Analysis

# Introduction
In this competitive business environment, customers are more demanding, with more power and expectations than ever. Customer happiness is considered a key driver for any organization to grow its operations, and maximize its revenue at an optimum level. Therefore, many organizations are recognizing the importance of utilizing big data technology to better understand their customers and the factors that drive their satisfaction. 

Incorporating artificial intelligence driven solutions enables companies to become more customer centric by analyzing unstructured data, highlighting key customer information and have it immediately accessible to decision makers.  

The project will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to cluster customers and classify if a customer is happy, neutral or angry, and be able to match a customer service representative to keep the customer pleased. In a nutshell this project is not utilizing AI to replace customer support teams, but using AI technology to make customer support more effective, and data driven. 

# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to design and develop an intelligent customer support algorithm with sentimental analysis that will help a business serve their customers effectively while lowering support costs, and increasing customer loyalty. The below points define the key problems the project is trying to address throughout the project development life cycle:
- Gaining better insights and understand the factors that influence the customer opinions about a product and/or a service;
- Enhancing customer service processes by bringing customer feedback from multiple channels, into a single data lake to analyze;
